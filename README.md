# Weibo_finance
The best application of this repositary is: 
building a domain specific dictionary using all provided texts in one particular domain.

The amazing thing is that 
(1) it doesn't require labelled data;
(2) it doesn't require an explicit dictionary.

I applied this tool to parse financial tweets from Weibo. 
The word counts can be used as a reliable financial dictionary for parsing Chinese text using HanLP.

Important note: this tool is actually not good at parsing. It works best to build dictionary for other more advanced parsing systems.
